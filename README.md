This project of mine logs every internet connection and saves it into the access database. It is hidden when started but you can press F9 to see when it was connected/disconnected since the program was started in a listbox. Its a really good project which illustrates diffrent techniques in diffrent subjecs such as database, listbox, internet etc.
